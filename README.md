## Inspiration
Right from the beginning, we & our doctors have faced a great issue of tracking our medical history. We have stockpiled a lot of medical records, prescriptions, and medical test reports in our cupboard for a long time. So whenever we used to go to a doctor, he was not able to follow up our treatment as he was not aware of our past records. So we thought , why not create a single point of access for both doctors as well as patients in the form of an app such that all the records of the patient are accessible to the doctor so that he can follow up our case more efficiently. We were also aware of the fact that a large number of fitness tracking apps are there in the market. So we thought of making making our own fitness tracker which will not only predict the right things we should do as per the goal set by us, but feed our doctors about our fitness regime. To make this app accessible to all, we also had an aim to develop something for those who are not able to see properly. For them we proposed to scan the prescription through camera, extract useful information out of it and to read it aloud to them so that they can be well aware about their prescription. Also, we wanted to make a reminder system for medicines based on the prescription image we uploaded.

## What it does
*Try out by installing apk : APK *

Currently, our app has two modes to run, one is the medical mode and the other is the fitness zone mode. In the fitness zone mode, the user can set the parameters of different fields on the daily basis and set up a goal. Our app, based on the algorithms developed by us would suggest them what they should do & how much time it would take to achieve their goal. Everything that the user updates is set in our cloud database, so that they can be seen by their medical doctors as well if needed. In the Medical zone, there is a facility to add your prescriptions along with all the other field, so that they can be viewed by your doctor and by you as well for the future reference, thus creating a single point of accessing information for both of them. Also, for the accessibility purpose, there is a facility to upload one's prescription and based on the ML OCR technology access all the text written in it. Then based on our algorithm, useful information is extracted from the prescription like the medicine name, dose etc. There is a feature of reading out the prescription as well for those who can't see properly so that our own phone would read you the prescriptions. There are many more things in the app too.

## How we built it
We built it with the use of Flutter Framework, Google Firebase for backend, ML OCR based models for text recognition, Canva for assets generation & Figma for UI designing.

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge faced by our team was that we were all new to the field of development and making large projects in general. Also, we had an aim to make the app as simplistic as possible so that it is easily accessible to all the people. To make sure that we incorporate all features as per the inspiration of our project, we did at least a hundred google searches in order to learn new technologies so as to incorporate them in our app. Like for instance, we didn't knew how would we implement ML models in our app, so we spent a complete night for learning how to do this. But after all the brainstorm and hardwork, we were able to make a good product.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The biggest accomplishment that we are all proud of is that we were able to convert our inspiration into a real life working app in just two days. We learnt a lot of things together and also experienced the process of working in a team. We were develop a great experience for our app users. We are proud that most of the features we dreamt of have become a reality! See our code at code

## What we learned
Foremost, we learned the most important skill of how to work in a team efficiently as time was very less. We learnt the basics of Flutter, using backend, using cutting edge ML-technologies & of-course making a good user experience.

## What's next for Health Bloom
We have completed the user end of the App till it's beta version. In parallel we are developing the doctor side of the app so that he/she can see the status of his/her patients. Also, for the patient side app, we are trying to make our predictions more accurate & to also brainstorming for more ideas to implement.
